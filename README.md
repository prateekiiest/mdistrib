We present here the code for Distributed MicroCluster Detection in Large Data Streams

- data
    - Contains related data for our experiments (including DARPA dataset)
- models
    - Both Distributed Method for Count Min Sketch (CMS) and Frequent Item Sketch (FIS) data sketches.
- visualisations
    - Experimental plots and sample examples
    

The entire code is written in python and we use dask library for our distributed operations.
